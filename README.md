# Theft Detection

This appis intended to setup on local security cameras. Depends on the camre position, on the first setup you need to draw the line for customer should not pass and which side customer is, then this information will be saved in the json file.

After that when a person hands passes the border you set, it will set an alarm. 

Alarm condition can be configured to raise any physical kind alarm if needed. 

There is a sample video to test in repo.
